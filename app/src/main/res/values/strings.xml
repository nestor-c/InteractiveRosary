            Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,\n

            He arose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, sitteth at the right\n
            hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the \n
            living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church,\n

            This was to fortify their faith to withstand the coming tragedy of the Passion.\n
            Jesus foresaw the \'scandal of the cross,\' and prepared them for it by this manifestation of His glory.\n
            Moses and Elias (representing the Law and the prophets of the Old Testament) were conversing with Jesus about His passion.\n
            "Do not think I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets... but to fulfill them."\n
            From a cloud came a voice: "This is my beloved Son, listen to Him."\n
            Jesus admonishes them not to tell the vision to anyone until the Son of Man rises from the dead.\n
            We too will behold the transfigured Jesus on the Last Day.\n

            The Fifth Luminous Mystery -\n
            THE INSTITUTION OF THE EUCHARIST\n\n
            I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.\n
            Jesus took bread, blessed it: "Take and eat, this is My Body."\n
            Taking the wine: "This cup is the new covenant in my Blood, shed for you."\n
            At that Eucharistic meal, Jesus celebrated the first Mass.\n
            At every Mass the sacrifice of Calvary is made present.\n
            At the Last Supper Jesus instituted the sacrament of Holy Orders to perpetuate this sacrifice.\n
            "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him."\n
            The Eucharist is a sacrifice inasmuch as it is offered up, and a sacrament inasmuch as it is received.\n
            In the Mass we offer ourselves to God, and God gives himself to us.\n
            The Mass will be fruitful in the measure of our surrender to the Father.\n
